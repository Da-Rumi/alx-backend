📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Redis-backed queuing system in Node.js using Kue for job processing and Express.js for API interaction. It covers:
✔ Redis basics (storage, hashes, async operations)
✔ Kue job queue management (deprecated but industry-relevant)
✔ Express.js server interacting with Redis

⏳ Timeline:

Start: Jun 16, 2025, 6:00 AM

End: Jun 19, 2025, 6:00 AM

QA Review: Manual review required (request when ready).

🚀 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
✅ Run a Redis server locally.
✅ Perform basic operations with the Redis CLI.
✅ Use Node.js Redis client (redis npm package).
✅ Store hash values in Redis.
✅ Handle async Redis operations in Node.js.
✅ Implement a Kue-based job queue.
✅ Build an Express app that interacts with Redis.
✅ Integrate Express + Redis + Kue for job processing
